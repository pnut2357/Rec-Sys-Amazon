From the millions items in online stores, it is hard to believe which item would be the best for customers. The given information of reviews and ratings from other customers help, but a recommender system assist to make a better and smart decision. \n",

The dataset is categorically divided; for this project, category of **Video Games** was chosen. For the practical prupose, item metadata of json file was loaded. \n",

    "### 3.1 Content-based Filtering (CBF) System\n",
    "Content-based Filtering is a learning system to recommend by analyzing the feature similarity among items. For instance, based on user's actual ratings for different genre of movies, the system will learn to recommend the genre which is positively rated by the user. \n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/content-based.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the similarity between items, various different similarity metrics can be used. Practically, the items in the current amazon data with meta information can be analyzed to extract features like sentiment score, rating score, or TF-IDF score for finding the similarity relationship among the items. However, the more features, the more dimensions we need; due to the curse of dimensionality, features should be well defined as well as similarity metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/sim_rel.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The popular CBF is 1) Vectorization + Similarlity and 2) TF-IDF. The first method is that the vectorized item can be found similar relationship via similarity metrics, the second one is based on weighing TF (Term-Frequency; number of specific terms that appeared in specific doc) and the specialized terms that appears only specific documents via DF (number of docs that specific terms appeared) because TF does not proportional to importance so it is needed to penaltize the TF.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros of CBF\n",
    "    - User Independence: compared to user-based CF which needs other user's information, CBF needs only single user's profile. It has a less computations and may perform better if extracting features for similarity between items is well done.\n",
    "    - Transparency on Feature-Level: it is clear that CBF based on selected features while user-based CF needs other users' interactions. \n",
    "    - Less Cold Start: CF usually faces with Cold Start that if other users have no information related to items. However, CBF has no Cold Start if current user has information like transaction history or rating history.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Cons of CBF\n",
    "    - Limited Content Analysis: the less information, the less accuate the recommendation (prediction) would be. \n",
    "    - Over-specialization: User may want some new experience (can be measured by novelty), but it is not great that recommended items would be expected all the time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "> NOTE: Similarity Metrics can be used by both CBF and Memory-based CF for neighboring. \n",
    "#### Similarity Metrics\n",
    "There are Cosine, MSD (Mean Squared Difference), Pearson (Pearson correlation coefficient), and many other metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Collaborative Filtering (CF) System\n",
    "Unlike content-based CF use explicit features such as genre of movies, it is hard to extract important features in most cases with tenmendous amount of data. Then, user-item matrix is simply a starting point to grasp a pattern between users and items. The following figure shows user-item matrix.\n",

This matrix helps vectorizing the users' preferences and items' features. Then, how to suggest the movie to individuals based on personal preferance? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main appraoches to CF: Model-based and Memory-based. Model-based CF (Latent Factor CF) is based on Factorization of features for users and items while Memory-based CF (neighborhood CF) is based on neighboring an object. If this object is user, the system (called user-based CF) learns the preference similarity between current user and the other users to recommend items. If the object is item, the system (called item-based CF) learns the interactions between items from current user's \"behavior\". \n",

    "> NOTE: Content-based filtering learns **content** of items to find the similarity while item-based CF learns **user behavior** on the items with meta data of current users' interactions through transaction history, ratings, selection (wish-list) information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 Model-based CF\n",
    "The most popular model-based CF is SVD, which was used for Netflix competition 2009. SVD vectorizes preferences of users and features of items into two latent vectors; user latent and item latent. This separation is called Matrix Factorization. From the separation, users and items can be projected in a smaller dimension space (dimensionality reduction) to observe preference of users on features of items. These projected users and items should be grouped (clustering). \n",
    "\n",
    "Real world data is often jointly interacted between multiple entities. However, here we are intereted in two entities; users and items, which means the user-item matrix has join interaction between users and items. For instance, user 1 rating item 1 is affected by both the preference of user 1 (affinity to some subjects/categories) and the feature of item 1 (its caracteristic belongs to some subjects/categories); called bimodel. Based on similarity of these pairwise interactions, co-clustering (grouping user side and item side simutaneously) is the main poin in Model-based CF.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Co-clustering works well especially for when pairwise interactions is sparse. Suppose that user 1 and user 2 have similar affinity to same youtube categories. It is clear that user 1 and 2 will watch the same youtube clip becuase copious amount of clips is generated daily. Then the user-item matrix have sparse interactions. In this case, clustering similar users (user-based CF in neighboring) or clustering similar items (item-based CF in neighboring) is not useful for recommendation. When co-clustering overshadow regular unimodel clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2.1.1 SVD + SGD\n",
    "SVD ,a matrix factorization, vectorize preferences of users and features of items into user latent ($U$) and item latent ($\\Sigma V^T$) (more concisely $U\\sqrt{\\Sigma}$ and $\\sqrt{\\Sigma}V^T$). \n",

    "### 4.2 Item-based CF by Surprise\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory-based CF finds similarity between objects (either users or items) with the neighboring method. For Item-based CF, the object is defined as an item so that the system learns the interactions between items from current user's \"behavior\" to recommend the items similar to the items that current user have positively rated. KNN algorithm was introduced, but upgraded version of KNN (`KNNWithMeans()`) was used. While KNN naively finds the similar items (or user), `KNNWithMeans()` subtract the mean value of item (or user) ratings to modulate users' judgement based on mean rating just like the relationship between Cosine and Pearson similarities. It is important because each user has different createria of rating for items. An interesting fact is that Item-based CF works better than User-based one for the old items because item mean rating is not extremely affected by one user's rating whreas user mean rating is sensitive.
